# eagle-view-escapes

A one page travel agency demo website showcasing what I think are 2018's best practices (UX, SEO, accessibility, performance) and built using modern front-end development workflow.

Visit page here: https://stephanorgiazzi.github.io/eagle-view-dist/

## Built With

* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Automate and enhance development workflow
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) - A modular CSS processor
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Bundle modules and dependencies
* [Babel](babeljs.io/) - JavaScript compiler allowing support for ES2015 JavaScript through syntax transformers

I also experimented with the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) method for CSS, which I find interesting and will probably use again in the future.

### UX

Fully responsive website, cross-browser accessible and optimized for mobile.
Google User Experience Score: 96/100

### Performance

This page has been optimized for best performances:
  - Minified JS and CSS using Uglify and CSSNano
  - Compressed images using Imagemin
  - Sprites, generated automatically using SVG-sprites
  - Lazy-loaded images using lazysizes
  - Extensive use of Responsive images (different sizes and DPIs to match the user's current display)

### SEO

This website is following the latest recommendations in terms of SEO, making use of meta tags that really matter such as Open Graph and Twitter cards meta tags.
